                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">Our Story</h2>
                <p>Pen and I Publishing was born from the realisation that too many family stories are lost with each passing generation. We started with a simple mission: to help people preserve their memories in their own words, not for fame or fortune, but for the priceless gift of shared experiences.</p>
                
                <p>Based in the UK, we bring a warm, approachable perspective to memoir writing that embraces the British tradition of storytelling with a cup of tea in hand and a focus on the quietly meaningful moments of life.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">Join Us</h2>
                <p>Whether you're writing for yourself, your children, or your grandchildren yet to be born, we invite you to pick up your pen. Your story matters, and we're here to help you tell it, one prompt at a time.</p>
