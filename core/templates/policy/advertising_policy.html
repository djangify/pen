                <p class="mb-4">We really appreciate you checking out everything on offer here at Pen and I Publishing. For the most part, when you click a link you will be taken to one of our many free resources; however, sometimes you may be taken to an outside resource or website. This disclosure explains our advertising practices and affiliate relationships.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Affiliate Links</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">In some instances, if you are encouraged to buy or sign up for something, you can assume that this is an affiliate link. Being an affiliate means if we recommend someone from our website to an outside service, they may compensate us by paying an affiliate fee. This does not affect you or your rights in any way.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">The exception to this is links to our paperback notebooks on Amazon, as we create these ourselves.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">When it is within our control, we promise to always promote products and services that serve your higher good. We only recommend products and services that we believe in and would use ourselves.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">There may be ads shown on blog posts, in the sidebar, at the end of a blog post, or on the homepage. Wherever you see Google advertising, please only click if you are genuinely interested in the product.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">The advertising shown is not controlled by Pen and I Publishing â€“ we have little control over what is displayed.
